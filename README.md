## Syllabot - AI Syllabus Assistant for Students

Claude is be configured to load the course context including the schedule, materials, and assignments as they are posted. Follow the instructions in Course Information and ask:

- "What's the next assignment due?"
- "What is PLCC?"
- "Explain the difference between syntax and semantics"
- "Help me implement this grammar"

Programming Assignments are intended to be completed based on the provided course material and in-class lectures. Remember Claude makes mistakes and can only accomplish what you can describe. Use algorithms for learning at your own risk.
