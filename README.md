## Course Overview

This course covers multiple programming paradigms and languages:
1. **Procedural Programming** - C
2. **Functional Programming** - JavaScript  
3. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Java/Python
4. **Logical Programming** - Prolog (introduction)
5. **Language Implementation** - PLCC
6. **Modern Multi-Paradigm** - Rust

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand different programming paradigms and their trade-offs
- Master key concepts like scope, binding, type systems, and memory management
- Implement interpreters and understand language implementation
- Compare and contrast features across different programming languages
- Apply appropriate paradigms to solve various computational problems

## Assessment Rubrics

### Programming Assignments
- **Functionality** (40%): Does it work correctly?
- **Design** (25%): Is it well-structured?
- **Style** (15%): Is it readable and documented?
- **Testing** (20%): Are there comprehensive tests?

### Exams
- **Conceptual Questions** (40%): Paradigm understanding
- **Code Analysis** (30%): Read and explain code
- **Code Writing** (30%): Write small programs

## Course Philosophy

This course takes a **comparative and practical approach** to teaching programming languages. Rather than being purely theoretical, students will:
1. Write code in multiple languages (C, JavaScript, Java, Python, Rust)
2. Build their own interpreter to understand language implementation
3. Compare paradigms through hands-on projects
4. Apply appropriate paradigms to real problems

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Modern Language Selection
- **Classic foundations**: C (procedural), Java (OO)
- **Modern multi-paradigm**: JavaScript, Python, Rust
- **Practical focus**: Languages students will actually use

### 2. Project-Based Learning
Each assignment builds practical skills:
- PA0: Environment setup across multiple languages
- PA1: Memory management and data structures (C)
- PA2: Functional programming patterns (JavaScript)
- PA3: Object-oriented design with patterns (Java)
- PA4: Build an interpreter (understanding languages)
- PA5: Type systems comparison (multiple languages)
- PA6: Modern concurrency and safety (Rust)

### 3. Implementation Focus
Students don't just learn about languages—they build one:
- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Parsing (building ASTs)
- Semantic analysis (type checking)
- Interpretation (execution)
## GitHub Classroom Setup

### Repository Structure
Each assignment should have:
```
pa[n]-template/
├── README.md          # Assignment instructions
├── .devcontainer/     # Development container config
├── tests/             # Provided test cases
├── starter/           # Starter code (if any)
└── .github/
    └── classroom/
        └── autograding.json  # Auto-grading config
```
