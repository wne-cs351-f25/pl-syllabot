## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of CS351, you should be able to:

1. **Master language implementation** - Build interpreters and understand how programming languages work from lexical analysis through semantic evaluation using PLCC
1. **Understand syntax and semantics** - Distinguish between how programs are written (syntax) and what they mean (semantics) through formal specifications
1. **Apply induction and recursion** - Use mathematical induction and recursive techniques to define and process language constructs
1. **Implement scoping and environments** - Build and manipulate environments to handle variable scoping, binding, and lexical/dynamic scope
1. **Design expression-based languages** - Create and evaluate languages where everything is an expression, understanding evaluation strategies
1. **Master parameter passing mechanisms** - Implement and compare call-by-value, call-by-reference, call-by-name, and call-by-need strategies
1. **Build type systems** - Design and implement static type checking, type inference, and understand type safety guarantees
1. **Implement object-oriented features** - Add classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic dispatch to language implementations
1. **Handle infix expressions and arrays** - Parse and evaluate complex expressions with precedence and associativity, implement array data structures
1. **Explore logic programming** - Understand declarative programming through Prolog-like languages, unification, and backtracking
1. **Advanced control flow** - Implement continuations, exception handling, and understand concurrency models including Python's GIL evolution

## Course Philosophy

### Implementation Focus

Don't just learn about languagesâ€”build them:
- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Parsing (building ASTs)
- Semantic analysis (type checking)
- Interpretation (execution)
